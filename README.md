# Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three x's or three o's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares.

# Requirements
Your program must also meet the following requirements.

* The program must have a comment with assignment and author names.
* The program must have at least one if/then block.
* The program must have at least one while loop.
* The program must have more than one function.

# Suggestions
Make the game in any way you like. A few ideas are as follows.

* Enhanced input validation with user-friendly messages.
* Enhanced game over messages (x's, o's or draw).
* Enhanced board size (4x4, 5x5, 6x6 grid, or user selected!)
* Enhanced game display (different colors for each player)


# Solution
Compare your program to this version when you're finished. Ask yourself if you could make your program even better. You can also use this to help you overcome any problems. We all need help and inspiration from time to time. Don't make this decision too quickly though. It's in your best interest to complete as much as you can on your own.
